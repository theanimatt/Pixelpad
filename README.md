Niklas Reinsinger, Máté Bráder

App Concept: The App is going to be a Retro-themed note taking app. The app is a continuation of a project that was submitted as a final project for mobile coding.

Use Case:​ The app is supposed to be an „assistant“ in users everyday life’s. Whether its for shopping lists, reminders or just writing down thoughts - users can decide themselves, what they want to use the notes for. 
Users can create, edit and delete notes. Additionally users can assign one of 5 colours to their notes for categorising. Notes can also be sorted by colour, date of creation and alphabetically.

- Everyday life "Assistant"​
- Creating/Updating/Deleting Notes​
- Colour Notes​
  Sort notes by:​
    - Colour​
    - Date​
    - Name​
    - Lenght​
    - Priority​

​Target User​:
The app can be used by a variety of people of all different age groups. The only requirement is that users must be familiar with a smart device, at least on a basic level. 
(Estimated target user age group: 14 - 65 y/o)

User Evaluation: 

1. Test Overview
  - Objective:
To evaluate the usability of the note-taking app by testing basic functionality,
priority settings, and filter options. Feedback will be collected using the SUS
questionnaire and open-ended suggestions.

  - Participants:
5–10 participants representing the target user group (e.g., individuals who regularly
use smartphones, age group: ~ 15 - 60 y/o).

  - Scope:
Participants will perform tasks related to creating, updating, deleting notes, setting
priorities, and applying filters.

2. Test Goals
  - Assess ease of use for core functionality (create, update, delete notes).
  - Measure user understanding of priority settings and filter options.
  - Identify pain points or confusion during the tasks.
  - Collect user feedback on the overall experience and suggestions for improvement.
